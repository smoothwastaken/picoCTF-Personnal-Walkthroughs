## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Welcome !

This repository is my personnal walkthroughs of the CTF challenges from the [picoCTF website](https://picoctf.org/).

I _never_ wrote any walkthrough in my **entire** life, so I though that starting with these ones (CTFs) could be an interresting start !

*To clarify*, "**CTF**" stands for "**C**apture **T**he **F**lag". I will quote Wikipedia, because I couldn't say it more clearly, *so* according to Wikipedia:

>Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is **an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites**. It can either be for competitive or educational purposes.
[Capture the flag (cybersecurity)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)#:~:text=Capture%20the%20Flag%20(CTF)%20in,for%20competitive%20or%20educational%20purposes.)

I hope that this quick introduction make\ all of this crystal clear. Again, this is my first time, so don't hesitate noticing me errors or your misunderstading, I will do the more I can to help you understand. If you have any question, ask in the [issue github section](https://github.com/smoothwastaken/picoCTF-Personnal-Walkthroughs/issues?q=) !

Thanks for your attention and have a **nice** reading !

Formats from Reference managers can be converted into JSON and back. Using this approach, you are able to leverage the library to convert between other formats e.g. Bibtex to JSON to RIS behind the scenes.
