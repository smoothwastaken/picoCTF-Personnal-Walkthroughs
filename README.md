# picoCTF Personnal Walkthroughs
### Introduction

![Welcome To The Club](https://media.tenor.com/Xw9NRtyNMb4AAAAC/simpson.gif)
Welcome !\n
This repository is my personnal walkthroughs of the CTF challenges from the [picoCTF website](https://picoctf.org/).\n
I _never_ wrote any walkthrough in my **entire** life, so I though that starting with these ones (CTFs) could be an interresting start !\n
*To clarify*, "**CTF**" stands for "**C**apture **T**he **F**lag". I will quote Wikipedia, because I couldn't say it more clearly, *so* according to Wikipedia:\n
>Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is **an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites**. It can either be for competitive or educational purposes.
[Capture the flag (cybersecurity)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)#:~:text=Capture%20the%20Flag%20(CTF)%20in,for%20competitive%20or%20educational%20purposes.)

I hope that this quick introduction make all of this crystal clear. Again, this is my first time, so don't hesitate noticing me errors or your misunderstading, I will do the more I can to help you understand. If you have any question, ask in the [issue github section](https://github.com/smoothwastaken/picoCTF-Personnal-Walkthroughs/issues?q=) !\n
Thanks for your attention and have a **nice** reading !
